# Introduction

This project has one more interesting addition that is biometric door unlocking system.
Now we can easily unlock the door using our fingerprint through the same app , from which we control our homeappliances, so we don't need two separate app.
To unlock the door we will use our smartphone fingerprint sensor. 
To unlock the door just put your registered finger on the smartphone sensor, as you see solonied door lock is unlock by biometric finger print.
If in any case if any unauthorized person tries to unlock the door then his fingerprint will not recognized by the app and consequently he is not able to unlock the door,
